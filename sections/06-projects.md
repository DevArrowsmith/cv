## Projects

### 🚗 [TinyCarList](https://gummicode.github.io/tiny-car-list-app/#/)

TinyCarList is a mock car listings app. This full-stack project includes a React front-end and a back-end consisting of a MySQL database managed by Express controllers. The front-end procedurally generates listing cards from API datasets.

The UI includes a splash page which displays a featured listing with a nifty slogan, a filterable listings index and a submission form with password authorization. It also has some very neat menus.

The [front-end](https://github.com/GummiCode/tiny-car-list-app) is hosted on GitHub pages. The [back-end](https://github.com/GummiCode/tiny-car-list-api) is on Heroku.

### 🛰️ [NASA Image Search](https://gummicode.github.io/nasa-image-search/)

A search engine for the [NASA Image and Video Library](https://api.nasa.gov/). This React app performs state-based searches of the library using image metadata, parses images from the response body and procedurally renders them. API errors are handled and appropriate alert messages are displayed in the UI.

The git repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gummicode/nasa-image-search).

### 👩‍🚀 [SpaceFrens](https://spacefrens.herokuapp.com/)

This app provides a visual representation of people currently in space. Data is fetched from the open-notify.org API and rendered as an animated display. Assets were produced in Affinity Designer. A proxy API was set up to allow the browser to receive HTTP data from open-notify.org.
