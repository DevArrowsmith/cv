## Introduction
---
Following a successful career as a senior research chemist
I‚Äôm seeking my first position as a junior web developer.

I initially coded in JavaScript as a hobbyist. As my skills developed and I got to know people in the industry I came to realise how much I'd love to code professionally. I started an intensive self-training regime, progressing my skills from coding JavaScript functions to developing full-stack apps using contemporary technologies. 

My career as a scientist endowed me with numerous
complementary skills such as project design and management,
collaboration, technical communication and self-tuition.

## Skills

### üíª Technologies

```Chai``` ```CSS``` ```Docker``` ```Express``` ```Git``` ```Heroku``` ```HTML``` ```JavaScript``` ```Jest``` ```Mocha``` ```MongoDB``` ```Mongoose``` ```MySQL``` ```MySQL Workbench``` ```Node.JS``` ```Postman``` ```React``` ```React Testing Library``` ```Robo 3T``` ```Sequelize``` ```Supertest``` ```Vercel``` ```VS Code```

### üìö Self-Tuition

Thanks to the wealth of knowledge shared by the community I've been able to train myself in full-stack development. 

I started by learning JavaScript, then complemented this with HTML and CSS to produce static pages. I developed my back-end skills, learning to create MySQL databases and interact with them using an Express API. I've also tinkered with MongoDB and Mongoose. I've created several React front-end apps with responsive stlying. I've also produced testing suites using Jest, Mocha, Chai, Supertest and React Testing Library.

Once I find employment in the industry I'll continue to cultivate my skills in my own time, as much for entertainment as for professional reasons. 


### ‚úèÔ∏è Project Planning

As a professional scientist I've a lot of experience of project planning. The profession involves devising solutions to complex problems and selecting optimal routes on the basis of cost, efficiency, urgency and other factors. It encourages careful pre-consideration prior to action. I apply this methodology to coding. I take a reasonable amount of time to devise my approach prior to commencing a project.

Flexibility is also vital. Circumstances can change and new information can justify a change of approach mid-project. I'm sufficiently flexible to incorporate new approaches into existing strategy with minimal disruption.

### üî¨ Troubleshooting

Errors happen, especially when dealing with unfamiliar technologies, and learning to manage errors is a vital skill. I've a good eye for detail and I'm experienced at determining likely sources of error and methodical debugging. This is a vital skill for a chemist as physical systems can be extremely finicky. This skill translates well into coding.


## Projects

### üöó [TinyCarList](https://gummicode.github.io/tiny-car-list-app/#/)

TinyCarList is a mock car listings app. This full-stack project includes a React front-end and a back-end consisting of a MySQL database managed by Express controllers. The front-end procedurally generates listing cards from API datasets.

The UI includes a splash page which displays a featured listing with a nifty slogan, a filterable listings index and a submission form with password authorization. It also has some very neat menus.

The [front-end](https://github.com/GummiCode/tiny-car-list-app) is hosted on GitHub pages. The [back-end](https://github.com/GummiCode/tiny-car-list-api) is on Heroku.

### üõ∞Ô∏è [NASA Image Search](https://gummicode.github.io/nasa-image-search/)

A search engine for the [NASA Image and Video Library](https://api.nasa.gov/). This React app performs state-based searches of the library using image metadata, parses images from the response body and procedurally renders them. API errors are handled and appropriate alert messages are displayed in the UI. 

The git repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gummicode/nasa-image-search).

### üë©‚ÄçüöÄ [SpaceFrens](https://spacefrens.herokuapp.com/)

This app provides a visual representation of people currently in space. Data is fetched from the open-notify.org API and rendered as an animated display. Assets were produced in Affinity Designer. A proxy API was set up to allow the browser to receive HTTP data from open-notify.org.

The git repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GummiCode/spacefrens).
