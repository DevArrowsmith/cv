## Introduction

I'm a Software Developer experienced in web development with JavaScript and related technologies.

I currently work as a Frontend Developer at Twentysix, a digital agency with a diverse portfolio of clients.

I help deliver CMS-driven projects such as websites, digital sales aids and training tools. Though my commercial experience is frontend-focussed I'm comfortable working across the stack.

I also work part-time at [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co), a software development bootcamp. I teach web development fundamentals, and frontend development with React.
