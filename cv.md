## Introduction
---
Following a successful career as a senior research chemist
Iâ€™m seeking my first position as a junior web developer.

I initially coded in JavaScript as a hobbyist. As my skills
developed I came to realise that this would make a fantastic
career. I started an intensive self-training regime to progress my
skills from coding JavaScript functions to developing full-stack
apps using contemporary technologies.

My career as a scientist endowed me with numerous
complementary skills such as project design and management,
collaboration, technical communication and self-tuition.

### ðŸ“š Self-Tuition

Thanks to the wealth of knowledge shared by the community I've been able to train myself to create full-stack web apps.

I started by learning JavaScript, then complemented this with HTML and CSS to produce static pages. I developed my back-end skills, learning to create MySQL databases and manage them using homemade Express APIs. I've also tinkered with MongoDB and Mongoose. I've created several React front-ends with responsive stlying. I've also produced testing suites using Jest, Chai, Mocha, Supertest and React Testing Library.

Once I find employment in the industry I'll continue to cultivate my skills in my own time, as much for entertainment as for proffessional reasons. Coding is fun! ^__^
